# Stock Analysis with VBA + Excel 
## Overview : VBA Stock Analysis Project 
### Purpose 
 Steve wants to expand dataset to include the entire stock market over few years. The pervious code may not work for thousand of stock and it may take long time to execute.
 In this project, I will edit to refactor code. it will loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that pervious code did.
 Refactor is code more efficient using less memory or improving the logic of code to make it easier for future user it easier for future user to read.

 ## Results: Stock Code Performance 
 ### Compare Stock code and Timestamp Performance Procedure 
 In below image show original shows code takes 2.410156 seconds to run for 2017 report and images show original code takes 2.289063 seconds to run for 2018 report which takes  more time and more memory than refactor code for example ,it takes 0.5742188 seconds to run for get 2018 report and 0.3476563 seconds to run for get 2017 report.

## Summary
### Advantages  of refactoring code
- Refactoring code helps in executing the program faster
- Refactoring code use  less memory 
- Refactoring code  improving logic of code to make easier for future user to read the  code 
- Refactoring code makes software easier to understand and helps us find bugs 

### Disadvantages of refactoring code



### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

- Pros: -  Refactoring code will be better organized after refactoring and easier to understand . it won't be any more functional than it was before the changes. 
 Refactoring is just to change the structure of the code base, not its behavior.

- Cons: - Any time code changes, there is a potential to introduce a bug.
