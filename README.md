# Stock Analysis with VBA + Excel 
## Overview :VBA Stock Analysis Project 
### Purpose 
 Steve wants to expand dataset to include the entire stock market over few years. The pervious code may not work for thousand of stock and it may take long time to execute.
 In this project, I will edit to refactor code. it will loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that pervious code did.
 Refactor is code more efficient using less memory or improving the logic of code to make it easier for future user it easier for future user to read.

 ## Results: Stock Code Performance 
 ### Compare Stock code and Timestamp Performance Procedure 
 In below image show original shows code takes 2.410156 seconds to run for 2017 report and images show original code takes 2.289063 seconds to run for 2018 report which takes  more time and more memory than refactor code for example ,it takes 0.5742188 seconds to run for get 2018 report and 0.3476563 seconds to run for get 2017 report.
