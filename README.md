# Stock Analysis with VBA + Excel 
## Overview :VBA stock Analysis Project 

### Purpose 
 Steve wants to expand dataset to include the entire stock market over few years. The pervious code may not work for thousand of stock and it may take long time to execute.
 In this project, I will edit to refactor code. it will loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that pervious code did.
 Refactor is code more efficient using less memory or improving the logic of code to make it easier for future user it easier for future user to read.
